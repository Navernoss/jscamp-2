Theory is good, but without practice how to fly with one wing, so in this section we will solve problems in JavaScript. We took the tasks from the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/r/e67HyQ) - site this is a site where you can improve your skills not only in JavaScript, but also in other programming languages.

## Find numbers that are divisible by a given number

Complete a function that takes two arguments and returns all numbers that are divisible by the given divisor. The first argument is an array of numbers and the second is a divisor.

### Example

```jsx
divisibleBy([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2) == [2, 4, 6]
```

### Practice

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  const divisibleBy = (numbers, divisor) => {
    return ''
  }
  return divisibleBy([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2)
}
```

### Answer

See the answer only if you could not solve the problem yourself.

## Twice as old

Your function takes two arguments:

- father's current age (years)
- the current age of the son (years)

Calculate how many years ago a father was twice as old as his son, or in how many years he will be twice as old.

### Practice

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  const twiceAsOld = (dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) => {
    return ''
  }
  return twiceAsOld(36, 7)
}
```

## Count odd numbers below `n`

If number `n` is given, return the number of positive odd numbers less than `n`, EASY!

### Example

```jsx
oddCount(7) //=> 3, i.e [1, 3, 5]
oddCount(15) //=> 7, i.e [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
```

### Practice

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  const oddCount = n => {
    return ''
  }
  return oddCount(15023)
}
```

## Convert string to number!

We need a function that can convert a string to a number. What ways do you know to achieve this?

Note: Don't worry, all inputs will be strings, and each string is a perfectly valid integer representation.

### Example

```jsx
stringToNumber('1234') == 1234
stringToNumber('605') == 605
stringToNumber('1405') == 1405
stringToNumber('-7') == -7
```

### Practice

```jsx live
function learnJavaScript() {
  const stringToNumber = str => {
    return str
  }
  return stringToNumber('999')
}
```
